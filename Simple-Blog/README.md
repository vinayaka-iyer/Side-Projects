# simple-blog-React
A Simple and minimalistic blog web app created using ReactJs and Json server for the backend. <br>
It is a fully functional CRUD application but requires the Json server to be running, so the deployed project may not be able to fetch the data.<br>
Error messages have been created for the same. <br>
